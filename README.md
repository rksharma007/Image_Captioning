# Image Captioning

This is a Deep Learning project to predict Image Captions using Flickr8k dataset | Machine Learning

## How to run?
1. Download and extract [Flickr8k_Dataset.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zcgQpmIIrfBUpu4gmDV5wTMCS7wdxl0/view?usp=sharing) and [Flickr8k_text.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KU9RuF17Ymk2Vz0VKSD6snS50UqRV5_z/view?usp=sharing)
2. Now, create a folder named *ML* in root directory of your Google Drive.
3. Then upload extracted folder of *Flickr8k_Dataset* and *Flickr8k_text* into the ML folder within a folder *analytics_dataset* as per directory tree given below.
4. Also upload the *testing_caption_generator.py* into ML folder. Do change the file paths accordingly.
5. Now create a notebook in Colab by your preferred name, and copy paste from *image_caption_final.ipynb*
6. Execute all the cells.
